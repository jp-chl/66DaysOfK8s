## Takeaways

* _"A Certified Kubernetes Application Developer can define application resources and use core primitives to build, monitor, and troubleshoot scalable applications and tools in Kubernetes."_  -- (official site); more about CKAD certification in this [link](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/).

* CKAD is a proctored exam, and you have access only to the browser (linux environment) and the official Kubernetes documentation.

* You have to practice the basic concepts of Kubernetes like Pods, Deployments, ReplicaSets, ConfigMap, Secret, PersistentVolume, etc. Imperative commands are highly recommended; Take a look of the curriculum in this [link](https://github.com/cncf/curriculum).

* In my first attempt I've had to do simple stuff like Deploying a Pod with a specific image, expose a deployment as a service, create ConfigMap and Secrets, inject environment variables to a Pod, etc.
